# stk.works open sourced

This repo represents the codebase used for my personal portfolio website www.stk.works

I used React for the frontend and WordPress as a backend. The frontend gets data via an exported JSON file from the backend. In terms of CSS I used the well-structured *basecss* provided by @MarioSo (https://github.com/MarioSo/basecss).

Feel free to reach out for any questions at stefan@stk.works

Have a nice day,

Stefan
